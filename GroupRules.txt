Assignment# 4 Programming: Note on group work.

 For this assignment we will accept the assignment to be
in groups of at most two people (that is, it is either 
individual or done in pairs).

If the assignment will be done in a group of 2, this has 
to  be decided way ahead of the submission date. Groups
need to be formed at least one week before the submission date. 
In this case, the group formation deadline is November 28, 23:55.

If you are doing your assignment individually or in a group of 2, 
you need to self enroll on a group. 
For this purpose, a group has been create called Group A4.
We have also created a submission folder for these groups.

Students will organize themselves into groups
of 1 or 2 people, and then a unique submission per group will be received
for assignment#4.

Please add all group member names in all program files and report.
